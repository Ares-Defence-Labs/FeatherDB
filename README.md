# FeatherDB
a minimal, zero-heap C++ ORM designed for microcontrollers and embedded systems under 100 KB RAM. Built on a trimmed SQLite core, MicroLiteORM provides static data-mappers, fixed-buffer prepared statements, and compile-time-generated schemas — delivering relational persistence with predictable memory and zero dynamic allocation.
